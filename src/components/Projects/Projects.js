        <p className='ml-4 mb-4'>
          <p className='mb-2'>This project is a Python-based desktop application that combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) with sentiment analysis to extract,
            summarize, and evaluate news articles. Built using Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and libraries like Newspaper3k and
            TextBlob, the app provides an intuitive tool for analyzing and summarizing articles from URLs.</p>

          <i>Key Features:</i>
          <ul className='ml-6 mt-4'>
            <li><strong>URL Parsing & Content Extraction</strong>: Automatically fetches and parses article content, including the title, author, publication date,
              and summary, by simply entering a URL.</li>
            <li><strong>Text Summarization</strong>: Uses Newspaper3k's NLP capabilities to generate a concise summary of the article, enhancing
              content consumption efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong>: Integrates TextBlob to analyze the articleâ€™s sentiment, providing a polarity score (positive, neutral, or negative)
              to assess the article's tone.</li>
            <li><strong>User-friendly Interface</strong>: Built with Tkinter, the application offers a clean, intuitive interface where users can quickly input URLs and retrieve summarized content and sentiment insights.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2 className="ml-4 font-bold text-gray-700 mt-[50px]">Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Logistic Regression</h2>
        <p className='ml-4 mb-4'>
          <p className='mb-2'>This project applies Logistic Regression to detect fraudulent transactions from a Kaggle dataset. The dataset contains features like anonymized variables (V1-V28), transaction time, and transaction amount. The target variable indicates whether a transaction is legitimate (0) or fraudulent (1). Due to the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, various techniques, such as under-sampling, are employed to improve model performance.</p>

          <i>Steps Involved:</i>
          <ul className='ml-6 mt-4'>
            <li><strong>Data Preprocessing</strong>: The dataset consists of 31 features, with a target variable (Class) indicating whether a transaction is 
            fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0). Missing values are handled, and the data is divided into fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions for analysis. 
            Descriptive statistics show significant variance in the Amount feature between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Class Imbalance Handling</strong>: Given the imbalance (more legitimate transactions), under-sampling is applied to randomly select an equal 
            number of fraudulent and legitimate transactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Feature Engineering</strong>: The data is split into features (X) and target (Y), where features include anonymized variables (V1-V28), 
            transaction time, and amount.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Modeling</strong>: A Logistic Regression classifier is used to model fraud detection, with the dataset split into training and testing sets. 
            The model's performance is then evaluated using accuracy metrics to assess its effectiveness in identifying fraudulent transactions.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3 className="ml-4 font-italic text-gray-700 mb-6">Institute: IIT Hyderabad | Organized by: Technobytes</h3>
        <p className='ml-4'>During the summer training program at IIT Hyderabad, I gained foundational knowledge in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
          Machine Learning (ML). The program focused on both theoretical concepts and hands-on project work. Some of the key projects
          I worked on include:<br />

          <b>Voice Cloning using RVC</b>: I learned the fundamentals of voice cloning and implemented it using the RVC framework to replicate voices.<br />

          <b>Film Creation using Generative AI Tools</b>: I explored various generative AI tools to create a short film, integrating different
          AI techniques to bring together visual storytelling and machine learning.<br /></p>
